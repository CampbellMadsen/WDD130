                <h1>Is this a good trip for kids? What are the age ranges you allow?</h1>
                <p>Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all ages. We have found however that children over the age of 8 
                    seem to enjoy it more overall (And parents especially enjoy it more if their children are all over 8).  
                    A common concern we get from parents is that their children will be bored stuck on a boat for hours at a time. 
                    Surprisingly we deal with very few bored children of any age. The areas we are rafting through are some of the 
                    most beautiful in the world, and you never know what you might see around any corner. Not to mention the rapids 
                    which keep things very interesting. Each boat also comes equipped with a guide. It has been proven that river 
                    guides are unable to go for very long at all without telling stories...some of which are even true!
