      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>This site's purpose is to organize, store, and highlight the online music I've made over the last few years. 
        I have been using the same disorganized google doc for years now, and I want to make something more permanent.<br>
        The purpose of my updates is to make this site easier for me to use and expand.

      </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This will be meant as a personal archive, as well as an easy way for other people to listen to my music.
        I plan on linking this site in any bios for other websites, and it is what I will direct people to if they ask about my music.

      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        This website is meant to showcase my music, so I want the home page to feature what my most recent works.
        At the top of the page, there will be a large image of my most recent song/album cover. Below it will be a list of 5 or so songs,
        potentially related ones or just ones I'm most proud of. The list will function the same as the one on page 2 (I go more into it in that paragraph)
        so you can listen and get the link to the songs from the main page. I don't want this home page to be very complicated to look at,
        I want this page to look very clean. At the bottom of the page, there will be a "see full discography" button that leads to page 2.
        I also don't think there will be more than one main image on this page.<br><br>
        For my new addition, I will change the songs into JS objects so it is easier to cycle through them.
      </p>
      <p>Images for the Home page</p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Original Music</h3>
      <p>
        The second page of my website will be a list of all of my original music and remixes. I've made a lot of music in the past, 
        but a lot of it consists of covers that I don't care much about. That will go on my archive page.
        The main website I've used to make music is called Beepbox.co (and modded versions of it). It is a browser based note sequencer,
        so I can easily include links to view and edit the song along with sound files on the website.
        Because of this, I want to format this page like a table or list. Each row will show the cover art, audio file, and a link to the song in beepbox.
        I also really like to talk about my music, and want to include some commentary as well. My idea is clicking on a row
        will expand it to reveal a small description section, so the website isn't completely covered up by words.
<br><Br>
        For my new addition, I will store all of the songs as JS objects. I also want to make it so shift-clicking a song link will copy it to the clipboard.
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Covers and remixes - This page will be fully new</h3>
      <p>
        Along with original music, I like to make a lot of covers and remixes of other songs. Many of my old covers will go to the Archive page,
        but there are some that I'm more proud of and have made more recently. This page will have a different design from the discography page,
        without as many dynamic elements but with more information and features than the Archive page.
      </p>
      <p>Images for the Page 2 - None yet! I want to make more cover art for these.</p>
    </ul>
    <h3>Video Game Cover Archive</h3>
    <p>
      Before I started making my own music, I liked to make covers of songs (mostly video game music), recreating them under the limitations of Beepbox. 
      I started doing this at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, so you might be able to guess that I have a very large amount of covers saved.
      Most of my covers are not up to my standard of quality these days, but I still consider them an important part of my journey making music.
      I want to be able to archive them so I and anybody else can still access them.
      This page will look similar to page 2, with mostly the same functionality. However, I want the layout and visual design to look a bit different.
      Since most of my covers are of video game music, and since I don't remember the exact timeline I finished all of them,
      I think grouping them by their game of origin would be a better fit (and I can also use the game's logo for cover art).<br><br>
      For my new addition, I want to fill out more of this page and replace all of the placeholders. I also want to make it a bit more animated.
    </p>

      <h2>
        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Covers and Remixes</h3>
      <p>         
        This page will have a more compact layout than the Discography page, but it will have more detail and interactivity than the Archive page.
        Note: this only includes the wireframe for my new page I'm adding. My already existing pages turned out pretty different from my wireframes.
